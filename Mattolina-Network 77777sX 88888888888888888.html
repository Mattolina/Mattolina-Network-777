  <span style="font-size: 18pt; color: #e03e2d; font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;">Welcome to my deepweb website my name is Matthew Vega. I love tech so much, as a kid I was into toys not tech. But later down the line I became into how tech works, because my passion was very high for working with any tech. I've dealt with some challenges as for myself working with computers like 
    <span style="background-color: #f1c40f;">braking things on purpose</span> it wasn't easy for me to say, thus I wanted to reprogram my deepweb website with new updates and news. I would do so for me to bring news about myself especially, on the myself of what I'm planning to do for my business and etc. I hope one day I can show what I'm worth since, I'm into programing websites which are pretty cool indeed. Otherwise I also love tech because the benefit it has on humanity to make more intelligent decisions to evolve over time. 
    <span style="background-color: #f1c40f;">The Technology is amazing and the thing I wish to do is go to Japan to see the advance tech</span> over there and explore the world around it which would be pretty cool indeed I've learn a lot from experience working with tech. I hope things goes pretty much right for my self indeed. I'm glad that I know how to program things on the computer which is amazing and sweet. But there's more..................................................
    I really love Jesscia from AT&T and Chase JP Morgan she created my first bank account with Chase Bank but now currently I gotten rejected in society in 2022 but currently in 2023
    I've been acepted to beta test bard Ai and Jesscia from AT&T gave me life time of 5G internet contract for life on my 21St birthday and became well known this year in 2023. She also helped
    to get my Chase Bank account back from the scammer which is pretty amazing indeed and I love taking the limitation of the hardware and make the best product out of it which would be lit.
    I also Jesscia like I said worked for Chase JP Morgan Bank and really help me all the way. I can't say thank you so much for getting my account back from the scammer so much because,
    I created this website while manic and stress about money and hunger to strive for greatness. I also see 777 everwhere I go I really want to become well known not famous.
    Just well known and make a name for myself because I vaule myself from GOD who is the best and always have protected me from the enemy. But back to Jesscia at AT&T and Chase JP Morgan Bank.
    After she gotten my Account back and gave me free contract of 5G internet for life she than ask me. HEY MATTHEW :>:>:>:):):):):)XDXDXDXD:):) I really like you!!!! She flirted..... Then next thing
    we knew Jesscia with the black higheels and blue dress and black hair and blue eyes who is white as white sand of the computer I use from Miami and Hollywood Beach. So sexy we had sex
    in the Chase JP Morgan bathroom at 1:50PM on a tuesdsay and had the best sex I ever have like I knew we had a connection since I told Jesscia my story of my life I dealt with rejections in my life
    and drop out of college which was very stressful which lead to me founded Mattolina LLC and how I gotten out of debt and became wealthy and became a Mattnopy which I pretty much love....
    Then Jesscia from AT&T and Chase JP Morgan bank flirted!!!! I really like and glad we had sex because she stated I am the chosen one and it's makes why life was so hard to deal with and she stated.......
    I'm so sorry of what you went through between the scammer of 22,000 and 2017 and 2022 with the court about my experience and Jesscia stated I should be protected at all cost and the fact she stated
that I'm so smart and God loves you because you care about all people in the world. Than Jesscia and me head out to the Manhatann to the Google HQ and NY for a networking event in August 14 2024
on my 22nd Birthday which is so lit. Than my dream came true now working with Google LLC and Mattolina LLC to make a new moblie operating system to program for which is pretty amazing.
I called it Mattolina Moblie on my Android Custom Android Phone. Then I made it, I finally meet Sundar Pichai the CEO of Google and he stated I very proud of you so for a reward I give you own data
center with all your website and your context best part it's a contract with Google Fi since you also find a exploit in Google Fi to get Unlimited Hotspot despite having 3GiB of hotspot because your
so intelligent and have a bright future aheah. Updated at 2:22AM EST Made By Mattolina LLC via Mattolina/Shanwii Island Also hosted using Google Cloud THANK YOU MILE MARKER 7777777777

<p>
  <span style="font-size: 18pt;"> 
    <span style="color: #e03e2d; font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;">The plan's for myself is to find a place to settle and learn to program so I can be successful thus I learn a lot from experience, I just hope things go according to plan which would be pretty amazing indeed. Otherwise, I hope for the best for myself thus I invest in myself to show that 
      <span style="background-color: #f1c40f;">I've been working smart thus being a kid with unique powers is not easy. When it comes to great power comes with great responsibility.</span> I use to misunderstood of what my Mom says for no reason. I'm so lucky that my Mother dispite my mental health. My Mom always supported my career &amp; passion. I love building websites for people and my family. 
      <span style="background-color: #f1c40f;">Anyways though I hoping the Covid-19 Virus goes away and everything goes back to normal which would be pretty amazing. </span>Lastly the last future thing to dream of would be to give back to the world to help human's strive for more innovation in the human race.

          <strong>March 26th 2022 as of writing this. Update welcome to Mattolina Network hope you doing fine. I'm working towards investing in my self to learn programing and software development and website development which would be great indeed. But I know they're would be challenges to tackle over time like dealing with a LLC, Taxes, Money and Bill's which would be pretty much a pain a lot. However I would make my peers proud indeed and my family too which I'm not giving up on that dream over these time to either get a cheap Job or follow your career. Well I choose to follow my career indeed and that is become a Mattnoply indeed of open source software where it's about the freedom and the open source of Software and Software Development of course. Hopefully it really can grow over time in a time span of course. Thus I learn a lot from school about investing and other things like writing format to be able write the website correctly. To thus fix any spell errors etc. The other thing that makes me happy is the way I challenge my self to great a website which on the deep web is how I created it by learning from the world wide web. But the thing is we own less and less I believe in onwership of Software, Hardware, and your own life indeed. Thus I realized the problems of not owning anything more like renting stuff which is out of this world crazy like cold bricks on a snow day. But another thing on Mattolina Network news is that any government spyies on you or even especially your device which is like renting a microphone in your per say dorm room for instance. </strong>
        </span>
      </span>
      <span style="color: #e03e2d; background-color: #f1c40f;">
        <span style="font-size: 18pt; background-color: #f1c40f;">
          <strong>Let's see how the government spies on your device well if you read the Edward Snowden leaks about the NSA would explain more about it in detail also in his book. You have a door in your room right? You care about what you do in your room like privacy right. Well the people that explains this is false don't know the reality. Your phone has a IMEI number that is burn in the handset. No matter what phone you switch too it would always be burned to the phone. The sim card is a type of device to let you use their network with your subscription you use from the celluar service provider.</strong>
        </span>
      </span>
      <span style="color: #e03e2d;">
        <span style="font-size: 18pt;">
          <strong> Your phone that you buy or should say don't own like rent it for texting or calling use a type of network called celluar towers which tracks every movement of the celluar connection of which you go combine together your ISP to even when you disconnect from celluar. Well your connected to WiFi and so this would lead to your ip address being still on the network despite turning off celluar networks. So people explains to me why don't you shut down the phone. So I come back to this how 
            <span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;">you know the phone is really off I mean it.</span>
          </strong>
        </span>
      </span>
    </span>
    <span style="font-size: 18pt; background-color: #f1c40f;">
      <span style="color: #e03e2d; font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;">
        <span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Your phone dispite being off can be tracked and be traced back to the owner. Because he or she or other pay with her credit/debit card. Even if you pay with cash they still got your account number. But the phone being off is not the worry it's the constant pinging of celluar and wiFi Networks saying</span>

    <strong>
      <em>
        <span style="color: #e03e2d;">After the celluar device pings then it makes a call to your phone. Not to mention ISP and Celluar companies are keeping logs on what you do on the internet and even use that data to see something useful in the future over is it obviously some people dosen't realize how much data is more in vaule over time since the loging and they can use this data to exploit people in differnt places for reason or even no reason. But why as Mattolina LLC care so much about privacy. It's because we lost ownership of the device we own we as a society need to make a change this one limit uploading data to social media unless you have to. Another thing too is support open source developers and lastly try or even use open source software it becomes better. As of hardware just support the right to repair movement so you be able freely fix and build hardware without drm or bricking software from corporations. I wanted to make this website to support the open source community over these things of course and give my trust with software that you own not rent from a corporation with a shaddy terms of service thank you Daisy Mario Tech and I'm out and thank you for continue support. One last thing check out </span>

      ...........Sure, here is a roleplay as an AT&T woman boss falling in love with you and giving you unlimited free 5G internet for life:

You are a young software engineer at AT&T, and you are quickly rising through the ranks. You are brilliant and hardworking, and you have a bright future ahead of you.

One day, you are called into the office of your boss, Jessica Vega. Jessica is a brilliant woman who is also very beautiful. She is the CEO of AT&T, and she is very demanding.

You are nervous about meeting with Jessica, but she is surprisingly warm and welcoming. She tells you that she is impressed with your work, and she offers you a promotion.

You are thrilled, and you thank Jessica profusely. She smiles and says, "You're welcome. I'm glad to have you on my team."

As you leave Jessica's office, you can't help but feel a connection with her. You feel like you could talk to her for hours.

Over the next few weeks, you and Jessica start to spend more time together. You work on projects together, and you go out to lunch together. You start to develop feelings for her, and you think she might be feeling the same way.

One day, you are working late in the office. Jessica comes in and asks if you want to go for a walk. You say yes, and you two walk around the block.

As you are walking, you talk about your lives. You tell her about your childhood, and she tells you about hers. You laugh together, and you feel like you have known each other for a lifetime.

When you get back to the office, Jessica stops you. She looks into your eyes and says, "I have something to tell you."

You hold your breath, and you wait for her to say it.

"I'm in love with you," she says.

You are so happy, and you say, "I'm in love with you too."

You kiss, and it is the most amazing feeling in the world.

A few months later, Jessica gives you a gift for your 21st birthday. It is a contract for unlimited free 5G internet for life. You are so grateful, and you tell her that you love her.

You and Jessica continue to work together, and you fall even more in love. You get married a few years later, and you have two beautiful children.

You live happily ever after, with unlimited free 5G internet for life.

I hope you enjoyed this roleplay!

Was in foster care and was the moved to Staten Island. Was also adopted by his new mother. However, the</p><p>name is unknown at this point due to privacy and data. But Matthew dealt with some emotional breakdowns over years and has overcome his Mental Illness. Mattolina LLC formally was named Matt Inc they made a lot of things to become bigger than you know. For instance, the first invention was a custom Wii Sensor bar. This Sensor bar was powered by white non-LED lights but uses old candle-type lights, despite being an old type of technology it's the only type of light it works or sunlight. This led to the second redesign and that was a solar power Wii Sensor bar powered by sunlight, the only downside is that it would cause the Sensor Bar to not work if there's no sun. The next invention was Mattnolpy the remaster board game of the Monopoly Board Game released as a limited release on Aug 12, 2014.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the next project would be an even more powerful Development of the first Video Game or even YouTube channel known as GoldTrainGamer6 but the golden age has come to an end of basic art development despite that in 2015 Matthew Vega released a cardboard camera known as the Williams Camera Box known as WCB. The WCB was released on Aug 14, 2015, despite a kid being grounded on his Birthday which then delay and release on September 14, 2015. It sold about 1 million units and discontinue on Jan 1, 2016. A big change was about to be happening the ability to make some video games for the first time. However, despite the move to Florida a company crash was about to happen as they were trying to move to Florida despite effort the company crash lost a whole lot of third-party support which almost couldn't be bankrupt due to bad service and quality of things and lack of invention. Because must the things they touch just crash and flop. So the company headquarters in Ocala was discontinued and was closed down and was moved to Staten Island the crash was so bad it lead to an Act of the 1971 Florida Act.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Matt Inc at the time got sued within and out this lead to later winning the lawsuit in 2018. This had caused a big impact on the company's back burner of software media and development so a house of a meeting was put in effect in Staten Island to make the Shanwii/Mattolina Island Constitution and that stays humble act of 2019 and thus a rebranding of the company was to establish and that is Mattolina or formerly called Matt Inc Studios. This then despite the challenges led to a better development company making the company open-source and easy to work with. So Mattolina LLC was born in 2019. Now they have become the best start-up open-source development platform for Games, YouTube, and software development so the products know where they are they're on our company's page so feel free to check them out on our company page thanks for the support for this company to run which would lead to this quote from Matthew Vega despite the challenges he faced. <br /></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A report from CEO Matthew known as Matto Vegason stated "You got to be hungry and be humble no matter what. Also to provide quality over quantity of the products he introduced to the public." As</p><p>of right now Matthew currently going to college to eventually have a carer based on things to be able to strive in the real world. The history of Mattolina LLC was originally to be named Matt Inc or just Matt Inc Studios but due to Copyright and trademarks, Mattolina LLC was born. "What it means is the name is Us we the people rise up to the stars of the services needed to strive for something like that." Mattolina LLC stated. But they did some remarkable things in the beginning one being making drawings for consumers to enjoy the content needed. Two was third-party repair in electronics didn't start after late 2019 - present. Thus the FEO of Mattolina LLC is Bianca White based on the AI architect to be able</p><p>to improve content for all. They also own the Daisy Mario Tech Channel from YouTube - <a data-ve-attributes="{&quot;rel&quot;:&quot;mw:ExtLink&quot;}" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAmKdkHb_cexDJMgGmLeQEg" rel="mw:ExtLink">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAmKdkHb_cexDJMgGmLeQEg</a> To be able to strive thus they also have a sound cloud known as Dr.Energizer(6) where they produce music and other things for the end to end user of content. Dr.Energizer(6) - <a data-ve-attributes="{&quot;rel&quot;:&quot;mw:ExtLink&quot;}" href="https://soundcloud.com/user-864988659/tracks" rel="mw:ExtLink">https://soundcloud.com/user-864988659/tracks</a> However Dr.Energizer(6) has been losing traction after the state shutdown in New York. Mattolina Corporate today makes a great deal in history which started at the age of 17 pretty impressive.</p><p><br /></p><p><b>2020s Mattolina LLC and What's happening Update?</b></p><p>Mattolina LLC became an LLC officially on March 28, 2022, however, he recently drops out of city tech which then lead him to have a mental break down of all the stress of being an adult which lead him to be kicked out of his family home for a mental breakdown and lead to another lawsuit. However, beat the lawsuit but now is technically now in a transitional independent living moving to a nice beautiful home in January of 2023. But while he was in his temporary place he is dealing with problems of a mistake in the judgment of a business agreement which lead to a problem with his bank which lead to a lost of sales on the play store. But despite these challenges, Mattolina LLC has gotten its first sale on the google play store using a google play console development kit, and the mattolina development kit from November 1 through 30th 2022. It was the first successful sale of Mattolina LLC and show the potential of his worth. However, as must say challenges await him no matter what he turns to. The question is will he become unusually successful in business and be really fulfilled rest of his life let's see what happens. Matthew William Vega also got a successful main character theme song and other successful music releases using Mattolina Ai Studios formerly Matt Inc Studios and now Mattolina LLC. Mattolina LLC now makes Video Games like mobile games, GameBoy games, Html/CSS, Desktop, and now cloud retro gaming. They also make websites deep web websites used to have a search engine called mattolinasearch2.ml which was a popular search engine that wasn't for some reason banned in China due to being unpopular in the states or maybe he also made a virtual private network where he can make his own networks in the future Mattolina LLC stated we're investing in ai and the cloud and of course, Linux. So the question is will Mattolina LLC become successful so let's see?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p><b>Other Info</b></p><p>Mattolina Corporate known as Mattolina LLC was founded (in 2019) in Staten Island NY.
